# codon_ugene

## Description
An R script for analysing codon usage. It calculates, for each gene, the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU), the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), the Effective Number of Codons (ENC), the GC content, the values of GC1, GC2, GC3, GC12, the Relative Codon Deoptimization Index (RCDI), the frequency of dinucleotides and their Relative Dinucleotide Abundance, the proportion of aromatic amino acids, and the GRAVY scrore.

It also performs a Correspondence Analysis (CA) on the RSCU values.
